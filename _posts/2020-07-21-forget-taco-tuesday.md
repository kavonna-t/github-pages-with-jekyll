In the spirit of mixing things up, I have decided to say "Forget Taco Tuesday." To be honest, I'm a little bored with our weekly Taco Tuesday dinner. So, I decided today is Teriyaki Tuesday.
Tonight's dinner will be Teriyaki Chicken stir-fry. This meal is easy to put together because I am shortening a few steps.

Equipment needed: <br>
Large skillet <br>
Microwave <br>


Basic Ingredients:<br>
(1) 20oz bag of frozen diced chicken breast <br>
(1) 14oz bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables <br>
(1) 10oz bottle of Teriyaki Sauce <br>
(4) cups of cooked rice (90 second microwavable packets of rice are a fast and easy substitute) <br>


Extra Ingredients:<br>
Salt <br>
Black Pepper <br>
Crushed Red Pepper <br>

Feeling Really Extra? Add Five-Spice Seasoning! <br>



Let's make dinner! 

1. Place frozen chicken in a skillet and cook according to package directions. 

2. Place frozen stir-fry vegetables in microwave and cook according to package directions BUT only cook the vegetables for three-fourths of the allotted time. 
For example, if the package indicates microwave for 7 minutes, you will only microwave for 5.25 minutes.

3. Once the chicken is cooked to your desire season to taste with the extra ingredients. Add microwaved vegetables to the skillet and half a bottle of teriyaki sauce. Combine all of the ingredients well. 
Add more teriyaki sauce if needed.  Simmer the chicken, vegetable, and sauce for 5 minutes.  

4. If using microwave rice, cook the rice according to packet instructions while the chicken and vegetables are simmering.  

5. After simmering the chicken and vegetables, remove the skillet from heat.  

6. Get a large plate and put a healthy portion of rice on it. Cover the rice with the teriyaki chicken and vegetables. 

7. Eat to your heart's content!
