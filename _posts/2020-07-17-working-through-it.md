title: "Working Through It"

date: 2020-07-17

So much has been going on in the world over the past three months! In the midst of a pandemic, there have been demonstrations against inequality, racial injustice, and the failures within the criminal justice system.
Positive cases for Covid-19 have dramatically increased in the United States, unemployment is high and people are reintegrating into society. Schools are planning to reopen via online or traditional in-person instruction while students
and families try to navigate the best course of action during these trying times. With all of this going on, it is important to remember your mental health and physical health is important. This pandemic is a marathon
and will not be ending soon.  Let me share how I've been working through it since my last blog post.  

On May 10, 2020, my 30-day meal plan came to an end. Instead of creating another meal plan to sustain us for a month, I gave myself a break. I let the members of my household pull together our daily meals based on 
what was in the pantry. By unburdening myself with that responsibility, I began to spend more time working on my version of self-care. 

I have a CD collection that I acquired during my college years. I began to listen to those old CDs and reminisce on simpler days. I smiled as recalled time spent with friends I met during my first week at the dorm. I laughed when I listened to some of the music we used to party to during the weekends. 
Thinking back on those times made me realize many of those good days were how I coped with the stress of being a broke college student. I had far less than I have now and survived those years. This was the reminder I needed
to get a second wind for the next mile of this pandemic.

Although my state began to reopen restaurants and salons, I didn't feel comfortable being out and about. After learning my favorite pub was still in business, I made a plan to support the business by 
ordering a carry out meal every Saturday and picking it up from the pub. This was my way of easing into a new routine without the stress of being around people. Instead of going to the nail salon and being serviced
while surrounded in plastic coverings, I invested in a foot spa and heated massage seat cushion. I have a padded, high-back office chair that perfectly matches the width and height of the massage cushion. The massage cycles are better 
than the ones I experienced in the salon chairs. I placed water and essential oils in my foot spa and soaked my feet while enjoying a 20 minutes massage. While I relaxed, light music played in the background
and absolutely no one was talking or bothering me. Needless to say, I will not be returning to the nail salon for a long time. I created a relaxing space for less than the cost of two salon visits. 

While it is important to keep up with current events, I conditioned myself to turn off media outlets to preserve my peace. All news is not good news. In my opinion, many media outlets participated in gaslighting
the masses on a variety of issues. Quite simply, some "stories" were not worthy of my time or mental space. Being able to turn away from topics that drain me has been key to my self-care. Instead of making sure I watch
a newscast, I have read new genres of books that I typically would not incorporate into my reading preferences. My new reading adventures have provided a perfect escape from the daily pandemic realities during this time. 

Overall, these small acts of self-care have helped me continue to work through what many are calling "the new normal." While continuing to care for myself, I am prepared to last through this marathon.
